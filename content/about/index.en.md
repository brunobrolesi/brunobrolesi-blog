Hello, my name is Bruno Brolesi, I was born in Brazil, my childhood was surrounded by friends, we really liked playing basketball and video games. I've always been very curious, I took some computer courses at a metalworkers' union near my house, and I followed many tutorials on Youtube to learn more about photo and video editing. When I was 14 years old I had an Xbox 360 unlocked, and an update from Microsoft forced the need to update the unlock, at the time it cost R$120 in a store to do the update, as I didn't want to pay I found a tutorial and I updated the unlock myself, even without understanding anything of the procedures I was following. At school I was the person they always called to turn on the projector or fix the teacher's computer when something didn't work.

At the age of 17 I moved to another city to study Electronic Engineering at the Federal Technological University of Paran√° (UTFPR), right from the start I already had a greater affinity with programming. In the 5th period, I participated in a university Follow Line Robot, my team worked hard to build our robot, but we made several mistakes in the project and when we arrived at the competition the robot just run in circles. After finishing last in this competition, we learned from all the mistakes we made, participated in the Winter Challenge Competition,organized by RoboCore, and with the lessons learned we were champions in the next two university competitions.

In the following semesters I did two internships, the first lasted 4 months in an electronics industry of appliances for bathtubs and whirlpools, there I had my first professional contact with microcontroller programming and pcb development.

After completing the internship, I continued to improve myself in microcontroller programming and received an indication to participate in the selection process in a precision agriculture industry, where I did an internship for 1 year and was hired as an electronic designer. In this company I learned a lot about PIC microcontroller programming, pcb design, teamwork and vision of how a product is conceived until its launch in the market, going through all the difficulties of budget, suppliers, logistics and sales.

However, during this last internship I decided to migrate to software development, I found an ad on Facebook from Trybe course, I was approved in the selective process of Class 9 and after 6 months of course I got a job as a Full Stack Trainee developer, during that time as a trainee I focused on studying Nodejs, Typescript, design patterns, object-oriented programming and some design patterns.

In my professional trajectory I always seek to evolve my knowledge to bring solidity and scalability to applications. I believe in the importance of always being aligned with the business rules and guiding the application with reference to the principles of Clean Code, SOLID and Clear Architecture. Today I'm here to share some of the knowledge I acquire on a daily basis, because one of the best ways to learn are teaching and sharing.
