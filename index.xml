I&amp;rsquo;ve always been very curious, I took some computer courses at a metalworkers&amp;rsquo; union near my house, and I followed many tutorials on Youtube to learn more about photo and video editing. When I was 14 years old I had an Xbox 360 unlocked, and an update from Microsoft forced the need to update the unlock, at the time it cost R$120 in a store to do the update, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to pay I found a tutorial and I updated the unlock myself, even without understanding anything of the procedures I was following.</description></item></channel></rss>
